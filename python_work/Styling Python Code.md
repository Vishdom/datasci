When someone wants to make a change to the Python language, they write aPython Enhancement Proposal (PEP). The oldest PEP is PEP8, which instructs Python proogrammes on how to style their code.
The Python “style guide was written with the understanding that code is read more often than it is written. You’ll write your code once and then start reading it as you begin debugging. When you add features to a program, you’ll spend more time reading your code. When you share your code with other programmers, they’ll read your code as well.”
“The following guidelines will help you write clear code from the start.

## Indentation
Use four spaces per indentation level. (using four spaces improves readability while leaving room for multiple levels of indentation on each line)
in a word processing document, people usually use tabs rather than spaces to indent
