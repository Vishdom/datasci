#Checking for inequality
requested_topping = ['mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese']

#The expression requested_topping != 'anchovies' evaluates to True because the value of requested_topping is not equal to 'anchovies'.
#If the value of requested_topping were 'anchovies', the expression would evaluate to False and the print statement would not execute.
