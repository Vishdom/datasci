# Learning Roadmap

This repository contains my hands-on exercises and projects to become a full-stack developer with expertise in data science and design thinking.

## Structure

- `python_work/` - Python basics and exercises
- `frontend/` - HTML, CSS, JS, React projects
- `backend/` - APIs, databases, server-side projects
- `data_science/` - Jupyter notebooks, ML models, datasets
- `design_thinking/` - UX exercises, wireframes, design documents
- `notes/` - Summaries, cheat sheets, references

## Goal

To document, track, and build practical experience across coding, data science, and design thinking, progressively moving toward full-stack development.
